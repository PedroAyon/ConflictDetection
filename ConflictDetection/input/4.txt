Thank you for calling, how can I assist you today?

Hi, I’m having an issue with my account. I tried to log in this morning, and it says my password is incorrect. I’m sure I’m entering the right one, though.

I’m sorry to hear you’re having trouble with your account. Let’s get that sorted for you. Could I have your username or email address so I can look into it?

Sure, it’s jane.smith@email.com.

Thanks, Jane. Let me check your account… I see that there was a recent system update, and some password resets were required. This may be the reason you're having trouble logging in.

That makes sense. What do I need to do to get back in?

I can send you a password reset link right away. Just follow the instructions in the email, and you’ll be able to set a new password.

Okay, I’ll look for the email. How long will it take for the link to arrive?

It should be in your inbox within a few minutes. Be sure to check your spam folder just in case. Once you reset your password, you’ll be able to log in without any issues.

Got it! I’ll do that now. Thanks for your help.

You’re welcome! If you have any other issues or questions while resetting your password, feel free to call us back. We’re here to help!

I appreciate that. Thanks again!

Anytime, Jane! Take care, and let us know if you need anything else.

Will do! Have a great day!

You too!
