Thank you for calling, how can I assist you today?

Hi, I’m calling about my account. I was trying to update my payment information, but I’m having trouble doing it online. Could you help me with that?

Of course, I’d be happy to help! Let me guide you through the process. Can you please confirm the email address associated with your account?

Sure, it’s sarah.white@email.com.

Thanks, Sarah! Let me pull up your account. Now, if you’re logged in, you should be able to update your payment information under "Account Settings." Once you’re there, select "Payment Methods."

Okay, I’m on the page now. What’s next?

Great! You should see an option to "Edit" or "Add New Payment Method." Select that, and then you can enter your new information. After that, make sure to click "Save Changes."

Got it! That was much easier than I thought! Thank you for guiding me through it.

I’m so glad I could help! If you ever need assistance with anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re always here for you.

You’ve been so kind, thank you!

It’s my pleasure, Sarah! Have a wonderful day, and thank you for being such a valued customer.

You too! Thanks again!
