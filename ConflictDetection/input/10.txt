Thank you for calling, how can I help you today?

I’ve been trying to get through for hours! I’m really upset because my order hasn’t arrived, and no one’s been able to give me a straight answer!

Well, I can’t control how long you’ve been waiting. But since you’re here, let’s get this over with. What’s your order number?

It’s 5678901. And this is ridiculous! I paid extra for fast shipping, and it’s been over a week!

Yeah, I see that. Well, fast shipping doesn’t always mean "immediate." Sometimes things get delayed. What do you want me to do about it?

I expect you to look into it and make sure it arrives soon. I paid for a service that you’re not delivering on!

It says here it’s in transit. Honestly, I don’t know what else to tell you. If it’s delayed, it’s out of my hands. I can’t control shipping companies.

So, you’re telling me you can’t help at all?

No, I’m not saying that. I can check the tracking, but it’s really just a waiting game. If it’s delayed, it’s delayed. Not much I can do.

This is insane! I’m never ordering from here again.

Fine, that’s your choice. But the order will get there when it gets there. You’ll just have to wait like everyone else.

I can’t believe this... I’m done. Just cancel it or something.

Yeah, I’ll cancel it for you. But that won’t change anything. You’ll just have to wait for a refund. [sighs]

Alright, fine. Thanks for nothing.

Whatever. Have a nice day.
