Thank you for calling, how can I help you today?

Hi, I’m calling because I received the wrong item in my order, and I just wanted to see how we can resolve it.

I’m so sorry to hear that! Let’s get this sorted out right away. Can you provide me with your order number so I can look into it?

Of course, it’s 2345678.

Thank you! Let me pull up your order… I see the issue now. It looks like you ordered a pair of shoes, but you received a jacket instead. I really apologize for this mix-up.

Yes, that’s exactly what happened! I was really excited for the shoes. What can we do to get this fixed?

No worries, we’ll take care of it. I can offer to send you the correct shoes right away, and we’ll arrange for the jacket to be returned at no additional cost. Would that work for you?

Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you for being so helpful!

You’re welcome! I’ll make sure the correct item is sent out, and I’ll send you a pre-paid return label for the jacket. You should have the shoes in 3 to 5 business days.

Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.

I’m glad I could help! I’m so sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience. If you need anything else, feel free to reach out.

You’ve been wonderful! Have a great day!

Thank you, you too! Take care!
