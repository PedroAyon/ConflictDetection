Thank you for calling , how may I help you today?

Hi, I purchased a set of headphones from you last month, and they stopped working. I was hoping you could help me get a replacement.

I’m really sorry to hear that! Let’s get this taken care of for you. Could you please provide me with the order number or the email address associated with the purchase?

Sure, the order number is 11223344.

Thank you. Let me pull up your order… I see that your headphones were purchased a little over a month ago, so they’re still within our return policy. Can you tell me what seems to be the problem with the headphones?

The sound keeps cutting out, and sometimes they won’t even turn on.

It sounds like a hardware issue, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I’d be happy to send you a replacement. Would you prefer a replacement sent right away, or would you like to return the headphones first?

A replacement would be great! I’d rather not wait for the return process.

No problem at all! I’ll arrange to have a replacement sent out to you immediately. You’ll receive a return label for the defective headphones, and once we receive them back, we’ll complete the exchange.

That’s awesome, thank you so much!

You’re very welcome! You should receive an email with tracking details for the replacement shortly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

No, that’s all! Thanks again for your help.

It was my pleasure! If you ever need further assistance, feel free to contact us. Have a great day!

Thanks, you too!
