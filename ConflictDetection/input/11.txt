Thank you for calling, how can I help?

I’m calling because I received a damaged product and I need a replacement or refund.

Damaged? Yeah, sure, that happens sometimes. What did you order?

It was a blender, and it arrived with a cracked base. This is really disappointing.

Okay, so the base is cracked, big deal. Just use some tape or something, it’ll work fine.

That’s not acceptable! I paid for a new product, not something broken. I need a replacement.

Yeah, whatever. If you want a replacement, you’ll have to return the broken one first. You can figure out how to send it back.

But that’s not fair! I shouldn’t have to pay for shipping to return something that was broken when I got it!

Well, it’s how the system works. You don’t want a replacement? Then just keep the broken one and forget about it.

That’s terrible! I’m not happy with this service at all.

Honestly, I don’t know what you want from me. I’ve told you what needs to happen. Either return it or keep it. Your choice.

I can’t believe this. I’ll be complaining about this.

Fine, go ahead, see if I care. Good luck getting anywhere with it.
