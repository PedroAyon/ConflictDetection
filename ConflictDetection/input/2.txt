Thank you for calling, how can I help you today?

Hi, I’m calling because I was charged for a subscription I didn’t sign up for. Can you look into that?

I’m sorry for the inconvenience. I’ll definitely help you with this. Could you provide me with your account number or email address associated with the account?

Sure, it’s john.doe@email.com.

Thank you! I’ve found your account. It appears there was an automatic renewal for a subscription that was set up last year. Does that sound familiar?

No, I don’t remember signing up for that. I thought I had canceled it.

I completely understand your concern. Let me go ahead and cancel that subscription for you right away, and I’ll also initiate a refund for the charge. It should take about 3 to 5 business days for the refund to reflect in your account.

That would be great, thank you.

You’re welcome! I’ve processed the cancellation and refund. You should receive a confirmation email shortly. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

No, that’s all for now. Thank you for your help!

It was my pleasure. If you need anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

You too, thanks again!
