Thank you for calling, this is Sarah speaking. How can I assist you today?

Hi, I recently placed an order and I received the wrong item. Can you help me with that?

I'm really sorry to hear that! I’d be happy to help resolve this. Could you please provide me with your order number?

Sure, it's 1234567.

Thank you! Let me pull up your order... Okay, I see the issue. It looks like you ordered a blue sweater, but it appears you received a red one instead. Is that correct?

Yes, that's exactly it. I was looking forward to the blue one.

I completely understand your frustration. What I can do for you is arrange a return for the incorrect item and send out the blue sweater right away. Would that work for you?

That sounds great! How do I return the red sweater?

I’ll send you a pre-paid return label to the email address we have on file. You can simply print it out, attach it to the package, and drop it off at your nearest post office. Once we receive the return, we’ll ship the correct item to you.

Perfect! How long will it take for the blue sweater to arrive?

Once the return is processed, you should receive the blue sweater in 3 to 5 business days, depending on your location.

Awesome! Thank you so much for your help.

You’re very welcome! I apologize again for the mix-up, but I’m glad we were able to sort this out. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to call us anytime. Have a wonderful day!

Thanks, you too!

Take care!
