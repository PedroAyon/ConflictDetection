Thank you for calling, how can I assist you today?

I’m calling because I never received my order, and it’s been over two weeks! This is ridiculous!

Oh, great. You’re calling about that order, huh? Let me guess, it’s probably sitting at the post office or something. I’m sure it’ll show up eventually.

No, I need a resolution! I’ve been waiting for a long time, and I expect my order now!

Look, I’m just doing my job here, okay? I’m not the one who lost your package. Maybe check with the post office or something, since there’s nothing I can do about it right now.

I don’t want to call the post office! I called you because you’re the ones who should be taking care of this. Can you at least check on it?

Fine. Let me pull up your order. Hold on a second... Oh, look, your order is marked as "delivered." So, I guess it’s not our problem, right?

That’s impossible! I didn’t receive it! I’m telling you, it was never delivered to my address!

Well, if it says "delivered," then it’s not our fault, is it? I really don’t know what you expect me to do about it now. Maybe it was left at your neighbor’s house or something.

I’m not going to deal with this anymore! This is awful customer service!

Whatever. If you want to keep complaining, I can transfer you to someone else, but I don’t think it’s going to change anything. I’m telling you it’s been marked as delivered.

Fine, transfer me then!

Alright, hold on.
