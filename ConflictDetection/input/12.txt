Thanks for calling, what’s your problem?

I’m calling because I’ve been charged for a subscription I never signed up for. I want this fixed immediately.

Oh, great, another complaint about billing. Let me guess, you signed up for a free trial and forgot to cancel, right?

No, that’s not the case! I didn’t sign up for any trial. I want my money back.

Okay, okay. Let me check your account. Yeah, I see the charge here. Looks like you got charged for the subscription, but that’s not my problem. Maybe read the terms next time.

This is ridiculous! You’re the one charging me, so it’s your problem!

Listen, I didn’t make the system. If you’re going to keep complaining, you can deal with someone else. But as of now, your subscription’s still active.

I want a refund now! You’re really not helping at all.

Fine, fine. I’ll issue the refund. But you need to cancel your subscription first. Go to your account, and cancel it. I’m not doing it for you.

This is the worst customer service I’ve ever received.

Yeah, well, you’re not the first person to say that.
